%Unable to check whether the code is in the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-procedure-code|6.1.0' because the code system https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets| was not found%

# Examples include identifiers that are not defined in base specification
%This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient|6.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice) 
%This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner|6.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
%Constraint failed: us-core-5: 'SHOULD have a translation to the NDC value set'%


# INFORMATION: Discriminator type inherited from US Core
%The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# INFORMATION: Extension inherited from US Core 6.1
%The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# WARNING: This guide is meant to communicate UCSDI+ V3, so this guide is rooted in US Core 6.1.0
%The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# WARNING: Constraint consistent with US Core Document Reference in 6.1.0
%The slice 'uscore' on path 'DocumentReference.category' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true
